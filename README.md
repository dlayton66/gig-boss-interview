# Coding Challenge Instructions

You are the leader of 3 bands, and it's time to do taxes for the year (ugh, sucks right?!).\
Thankfully, you're working on an app that would make tax season a whole lot easier for musicians!

\
Each band has 4 members total (3 including you).
- For Band 1, you have paid each member over $600 total in the past year.
- For Band 2, you have paid each member under $600 in the past year.
- For Band 3, you have paid 2 members >= $600 and the other 2 members less than $600 in the past year.

\
Create a page that displays:
- How much you have made personally over the past year
- How much each individual band has made
- How much total all the bands have made (all 3 bands added together)
- How much each individual member has made (within each band)
- Sort ppl who made >=600 and <600
- Total amount of $ you paid to ppl who made >=600
- Total amount of $ you paid to ppl who made <600
- Search for a personâ€™s name and see how much you paid them (or dropdown menu)
