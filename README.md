# Overview

This coding challenge is aimed at our future implementations of our app's "Books" page.  Currently users can keep track of their income for the year, the overall income, and each individual band's income. Our future implementations will include a more thorough record of all of the above, with the addition of keeping track of Individual Musician Income, Tracking 1099 (those who Earn more than $600 from your bands), as well as an EXPORT option where all income information can be printed in a format that's easy to use for tax purposes. The following instructions will guide you through our Interview Challenge.

# Coding Challenge Instructions

You are the leader of 3 bands, and it's time to do taxes for the year (ugh, sucks right?!).\
Thankfully, you're working on an app that would make tax season a whole lot easier for musicians!

\
Each band has 4 members total (3 including you).
- For Band 1, you have paid each member over $600 total in the past year.
- For Band 2, you have paid each member under $600 in the past year.
- For Band 3, you have paid 2 members >= $600 and the other 2 members less than $600 in the past year.

\
Create a page that displays:
- How much you have made personally over the past year
- How much each individual band has made
- How much total all the bands have made (all 3 bands added together)
- How much each individual member has made (within each band)
- Sort ppl who made >=600 and <600
- Total amount of $ you paid to ppl who made >=600
- Total amount of $ you paid to ppl who made <600
- Search for a personâ€™s name and see how much you paid them (or dropdown menu)
